<h1>Machine Learning for Cross-Sectional Equity Returns Prediction</h1>
<p>This repository contains code related to the research on the application of machine learning techniques for predicting cross-sectional equity returns using factors. The goal of this research is to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms for enhancing the performance of factor-based investment strategies.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The repository includes the following folders:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>data:</strong> Contains the data used in the analysis, including factor data and stock returns data.</li>
  <li><strong>notebooks:</strong> Jupyter notebooks showing the implementation of different machine learning models, including data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation.</li>
